This is a java messaging proof of concept. The 
goal was to compare how the api looks between 
Spring3's AMQP support and its JMS support.

Running the examples  requires changing the
env.properties files to point to the correct 
broker. You will need a running rabbitmq
and active mq server.

You can run the examples by running either:
net.vijedi.messaging.common.AmqpExample
or
net.vijedi.messaging.common.JmsExample
